> Mass $M_{A} = 4 \text{kg}$ rests on top of mass $M_{B} = 5 \text{kg}$ that rests on a frictionless table. The coeï¬ƒcient of friction between the two blocks is such that the blocks just start to slip when the horizontal force $F$ applied to the lower block is $27 \text{N}$. Suppose that now a horizontal force is applied to the upper block. What is its maximum value for the blocks to slide without slipping relative to each other?

$$F = (m_{a}+m_{b})a \implies a = \frac{F}{m_{a}+m_{b}}$$
$$f = m_{a}a = m_{a} \frac{F}{m_{a}+m_{b}}$$

$$F' = (m_{a}+m_{b})a' \implies a' = \frac{F'}{m_{a}+m_{b}}$$
$$f = m_{b}a' = m_{b} \frac{F'}{m_{a}+m_{b}}$$
________________________________
$$\begin{align}
m_{a} \frac{F}{\cancel{m_{a}+m_{b}}} &= m_{b} \frac{F'}{\cancel{m_{a}+m_{b}}} \\
m_{a}F &= m_{b}F' \\
F' &= F \frac{m_{a}}{m_{b}}
\end{align}$$
$m_{a} = 4\text{ kg}$, $m_{b} = 5 \text{ kg}$, $F = 27\text{ N}$
$$F' = 27\text{ N} \frac{4\text{ kg}}{5\text{ kg}} = 21.6\text{ N}$$
