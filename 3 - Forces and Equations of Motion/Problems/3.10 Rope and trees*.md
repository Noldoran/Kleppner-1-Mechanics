> A uniform rope of weight $W$ hangs between two trees. The ends of the rope are the same height, and they each make angle $\theta$ with the trees. Find
> **(a)** The tension at either end of the rope.
> **(b)** The tension in the middle of the rope.

$2 T_{e} \cos\theta = W$
$T_{m} = T_{e} \sin\theta$

# (a)
$$\begin{align}
2T_{e} \cos\theta &= W \\
T_{e} &= \frac{W}{2\cos\theta}
\end{align}$$

# (b)
$$\begin{align}
T_{m} &= T_{e} \sin\theta \\
T_{m} &= \frac{W}{2} \frac{\sin\theta}{\cos\theta} \\
T_{m} &= \frac{W}{2}\tan\theta
\end{align}$$
