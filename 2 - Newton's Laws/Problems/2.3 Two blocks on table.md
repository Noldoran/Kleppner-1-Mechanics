>Two blocks $m_{1}$ and $2$ are in contact on a horizontal table. A horizontal force is applied to one of the blocks, as shown in the drawing. If $m_{1} = 2\text{[kg]}$, $m_{2} = 1\text{[kg]}$, and $F = 3\text{[N]}$, find the force of contact between the two blocks.

$$a = \frac{F}{(m_{1}+m_{2})} = \frac{3}{(2+1)} = 1\quad\text{[m/sÂ²]}$$

$$F_{c} = m_{2} \cdot a = 1\cdot1 = 1 \quad \text{[N]}$$
