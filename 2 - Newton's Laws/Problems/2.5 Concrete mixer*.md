> In a concrete mixer, cement, gravel, and water are mixed by tumbling action in a slowly rotating drum. If the drum spins too fast the ingredients stick to the drum wall instead of mixing.
> Assume that the drum of a mixer has radius $R = 0.5\text{m}$ and that it is mounted with its axle horizontal. What is the fastest the drum can rotate without the ingredients sticking to the wall all the time? Assume $g = 9.8\text{m/s²}$ .

Queremos que a aceleração centrípeta $a > g$. Já que $g$ foi definida como positiva, $a = r\omega^2$
$$g < R\omega^2 \implies \omega > \sqrt{\frac{g}{R}}$$
Substituindo $R = \frac{1}{2}\text{m}$ e $g = 9.8\text{m/s²}$, temos
$$\omega > \sqrt{2\text{m⁻¹}\cdot9.8\text{m/s²}} \implies \omega > \sqrt{19.6}\quad\text{[s⁻¹]}$$
